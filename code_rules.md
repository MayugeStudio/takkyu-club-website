## Code Style and Structure
- Use `CamelCase` for class names and `snake_case` for method names.
- Use 4 space indentation for blocks, avoid tabs.
- Open curly braces `{` at the end of lines functions.
- Don't use classes; It makes codebase unreadable.
- Variable names should be descriptive but concise. e.g., `is_visible`, `total_sum`.

## Best Practices
- Keep code simple
- Avoid premature optimization

## Documentation
- Simply describe what functions do
